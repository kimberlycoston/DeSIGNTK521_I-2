    "critique_and_rewrite": "[CRITIQUE]\n- Repetition: Several ideas repeat patterns with minor phrasing changes (e.g., 1 vs. 17 both zone filters; 3 vs. 25 both alert tuning; 7, 13, 18, 24 all \u201cmodes/cool-down/stepwise\u201d variations). This reduces breadth.\n- Vagueness: Many items don\u2019t specify what data triggers actions or what the UI shows (e.g., 6 \u201cExplain-Back Quick Chat\u201d doesn\u2019t state inputs/outputs beyond a summary; 12 \u201cRisk Heat Live Map\u201d lacks the specific risk signals).\n- Missing directions: No distribution guidance led to overuse of a few mechanisms and under-exploration of moments in the decision journey (before/during/after/ongoing). No tags to cluster by stage or fear type.\n- Weak Ring mapping: Although each idea names a Ring mechanism, the mapping is often implied rather than explicit (\u201cwhat Motion Alerts mean in investing\u201d is not consistently spelled out).\n- Safety mechanism clarity: Some one-liners clearly reduce anxiety (10, 13), others are generic reassurance without stating the specific uncertainty reduced (6, 21).\n- Emotional safety gaps: Social features (5, 22) could increase shame if not tightly scoped; the prompt didn\u2019t require naming which fear is addressed, so \u201csafety\u201d is broad and diffuse.\n- Feasibility: Most are plausible, but some depend on open-ended NLP or advisory gray areas (6, 14) without constraints to keep them implementable and compliant.\n- Clustering difficulty: Without tags for moment or fear type, the set is harder to organize and compare.\n\nPrompt causes:\n- It asks to use Ring-like mechanisms but doesn\u2019t enforce explicit mechanism-to-analog mapping.\n- No distribution constraints across Ring features or decision moments.\n- No requirement to declare which fear is targeted, so \u201csafety\u201d stays abstract.\n- No instruction to specify concrete triggers/inputs and outputs, enabling vague interactions.\n- No feasibility or compliance guardrails, allowing ideas that drift into advisory or complex AI.\n- Output schema leaves little structure for clustering or deduplication.\n\n[REVISED_PROMPT]\nYou are generating concept ideas for a design project.\n\nPRIMARY GOAL (non-negotiable):\nMake choosing investments FEEL emotionally safe and reassuring for young adults / beginner investors.

    "critique_and_rewrite": "[CRITIQUE]\n- Repetition: Several ideas converge on similar artifacts (many \u201ccards,\u201d multiple snapshot variants). While mechanisms are balanced, output types feel repetitive, limiting differentiation.\n- Vagueness: A few ideas (e.g., \u201cthesis drift\u201d via headlines, \u201ctracking error over years\u201d) risk unclear data availability or logic without specifying simple, obtainable signals.\n- Missing directions: No clustering structure beyond Moments; hard to group for product planning. Lacks explicit categories for onboarding, education, alerts, etc.\n- Weak Ring mapping: Most map well, but a few are thin adaptations (e.g., generic \u201cco-view\u201d shares) that could better leverage Ring\u2019s specific safety mechanics (zones, modes, privacy-first defaults).\n- Safety clarity: Safety targets are named, but emotional safeguards (tone, non-judgmental microcopy, anonymized sharing) could be more consistently enforced, especially for Social/Shared ideas.\n- Feasibility: Generally plausible, but some items may need niche data (tracking error history), which could exceed a 3\u2011month scope; more emphasis on mainstream, readily available signals would help.\n\nPROMPT issues that caused this:\n- The prompt privileged \u201cMoments\u201d over functional categories, making clustering by user need harder.\n- It did not require artifact diversity across the set, leading to many \u201ccard\u201d outputs.\n- It allowed broad data references (e.g., \u201cthesis drift\u201d) without bounding to simple signals, creating feasibility ambiguity.\n- Social/Shared features weren\u2019t forced to include privacy defaults, risking emotional safety gaps.\n- It didn\u2019t require distribution across functional categories, so coverage could skew.\n- It didn\u2019t require the safety mechanism line to explicitly name a safety target from a controlled list, allowing inconsistency.\n\nImprovements (constraints/additions):\n- Require category coverage: at least 3 ideas in each category (Onboarding, Decision Support, Risk Alerts, Education, Social Support, Post-Decision Support), max 6 per category.\n- Enforce ring_feature distribution: use each Ring feature 2\u20134 times across the set.\n- Artifact diversity: across all ideas, include at least 6 distinct output artifacts (e.g., badge, banner, modal, checklist, timeline, graph, alert, drawer, tooltip, snapshot).\n- Concrete inputs and outputs: each idea\u2019s \u201cwhat_user_does\u201d must name at least one specific input control and one specific output artifact.\n- Data feasibility: limit to mainstream, readily accessible signals (prices, percent changes, fees, volatility bands, diversification metrics, broad news headlines, user-entered notes/rules); avoid niche datasets.\n- Social safety: Social Support ideas must mention default masking/anonymization controls in \u201cwhat_user_does.\u201d\n- Safety mechanism precision: require the safety sentence to follow the exact mapping pattern and include one safety target from [fear_of_loss, fear_of_being_wrong, fear_of_not_knowing, FOMO, regret, shame].\n- Distinctness rule: each idea must differ by at least one of ring_feature, category, trigger/condition, or output artifact.\n\n[REVISED_PROMPT]\nYou are generating concept ideas for a design project.\n\nPrimary goal (non\u2011negotiable):\nMake choosing investments feel emotionally safe and reassuring for young adults/beginner investors (calm, non\u2011overwhelming, confidence\u2011building, low\u2011regret, low\u2011shame, protective, supportive).\n\nHMW:\nHow might we make choosing investments feel as safe and reassuring as using a Ring Doorbell?\n\nAnalogy reminder:\nUse Ring mechanisms as safety mechanisms, not superficial copies.
