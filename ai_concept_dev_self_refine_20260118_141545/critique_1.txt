[CRITIQUE]
- Repetition: Several ideas repeat patterns with minor phrasing changes (e.g., 1 vs. 17 both zone filters; 3 vs. 25 both alert tuning; 7, 13, 18, 24 all “modes/cool-down/stepwise” variations). This reduces breadth.
- Vagueness: Many items don’t specify what data triggers actions or what the UI shows (e.g., 6 “Explain-Back Quick Chat” doesn’t state inputs/outputs beyond a summary; 12 “Risk Heat Live Map” lacks the specific risk signals).
- Missing directions: No distribution guidance led to overuse of a few mechanisms and under-exploration of moments in the decision journey (before/during/after/ongoing). No tags to cluster by stage or fear type.
- Weak Ring mapping: Although each idea names a Ring mechanism, the mapping is often implied rather than explicit (“what Motion Alerts mean in investing” is not consistently spelled out).
- Safety mechanism clarity: Some one-liners clearly reduce anxiety (10, 13), others are generic reassurance without stating the specific uncertainty reduced (6, 21).
- Emotional safety gaps: Social features (5, 22) could increase shame if not tightly scoped; the prompt didn’t require naming which fear is addressed, so “safety” is broad and diffuse.
- Feasibility: Most are plausible, but some depend on open-ended NLP or advisory gray areas (6, 14) without constraints to keep them implementable and compliant.
- Clustering difficulty: Without tags for moment or fear type, the set is harder to organize and compare.

Prompt causes:
- It asks to use Ring-like mechanisms but doesn’t enforce explicit mechanism-to-analog mapping.
- No distribution constraints across Ring features or decision moments.
- No requirement to declare which fear is targeted, so “safety” stays abstract.
- No instruction to specify concrete triggers/inputs and outputs, enabling vague interactions.
- No feasibility or compliance guardrails, allowing ideas that drift into advisory or complex AI.
- Output schema leaves little structure for clustering or deduplication.

[REVISED_PROMPT]
You are generating concept ideas for a design project.

PRIMARY GOAL (non-negotiable):
Make choosing investments FEEL emotionally safe and reassuring for young adults / beginner investors. Interpret “safe and reassuring” as: calm, non-overwhelming, confidence-building, low-regret, low-shame, protective, and supportive.

HMW:
How might we make choosing investments feel as safe and reassuring as using a Ring Doorbell?

Audience:
Young adults / beginner investors

Analogy reminder:
Ring Doorbell evokes safety via Live View, Motion Alerts, Event History/Playback, Motion Zones/Sensitivity, Shared Access, Two-Way Talk, Modes Home/Away, Snapshot/Check-in, Privacy Controls. Use these as mechanisms to create safety, not as superficial feature copies.

Generation task:
Generate exactly 25 distinct, implementable concept ideas for a software service (mobile/web) that helps young adults choose what to invest in.

For EACH idea, include exactly these fields in this order:
- Name: 3–6 words
- Ring mechanism: choose exactly one from [Live View, Motion Alerts, Event History/Playback, Motion Zones/Sensitivity, Shared Access, Two-Way Talk, Modes Home/Away, Snapshot/Check-in, Privacy Controls]
- Moment: choose one from [Before, During, After, Ongoing]
- Safety target: choose 1–2 from [fear_of_loss, fear_of_being_wrong, fear_of_not_knowing, FOMO, regret, shame]
- Why this increases safety: one sentence that explicitly maps the Ring mechanism to an investing equivalent using this pattern: “In Ring, [mechanism] does X; here it becomes Y, which reduces Z.”
- User interaction: one sentence starting with “User …” that names at least one concrete input (e.g., toggle, threshold, selection) and one concrete output (e.g., card, label, graph, alert) the user sees.

Constraints:
- Balance: Use every Ring mechanism at least 2 times across the 25 ideas; limit any single mechanism to at most 4 ideas. Cover all Moments (Before, During, After, Ongoing) with at least 4 ideas each.
- Implementability: No hardware; software-only; plausible within ~3 months by a small product team. Use mainstream data/signals only (e.g., prices, fees, volatility, diversification metrics, news headlines, user-defined rules).
- Compliance/claims: No personalized financial advice, no performance guarantees, no trading signals that imply certainty. Frame outputs as education, rules, and explainable checks.
- Specificity: No generic clichés like “AI-powered personalization.” Every idea must specify a trigger, control, or rule and a visible artifact/result.
- Distinctness: Avoid near-duplicates. Each idea must differ meaningfully by mechanism, moment, interaction, or safety target.
- Tone: Prioritize psychological safety; avoid social comparison or leaderboards. Shared features must minimize shame.

Output format:
Numbered list 1–25. For each item, print the six labeled lines exactly as specified. Keep each idea compact (≤60 words total).
