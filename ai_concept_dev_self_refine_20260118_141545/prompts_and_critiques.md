## Iteration 1 Prompt

You are generating concept ideas for a design project.

PRIMARY GOAL (non-negotiable):
Make choosing investments FEEL emotionally safe and reassuring for young adults / beginner investors.
Interpret "safe and reassuring" as: calm, non-overwhelming, confidence-building, low-regret, low-shame, protective, and supportive.

HMW: How might we make choosing investments feel as safe and reassuring as using a Ring Doorbell?
Audience: young adults / beginner investors
Desired emotion: safety
Reference analogy: Ring Doorbell (monitoring, alerts, event history, zones/sensitivity, shared access, two-way talk, modes, privacy)

IMPORTANT:
Ring Doorbells evoke safety through mechanisms like passive monitoring, timely alerts, visibility/clarity, event history, user-controlled sensitivity, shared access, and quick access to help.
Use these as MECHANISMS to create the feeling of safety, not as superficial feature copying.

TASK:
Generate exactly 25 concept ideas for a service that helps young adults choose what to invest in.

For EACH idea, include:
1) Idea name (3–6 words)
2) Ring mechanism used (choose one): Live View, Motion Alerts, Event History/Playback, Motion Zones/Sensitivity, Shared Access, Two-Way Talk, Modes (Home/Away), Snapshot/Check-in, Privacy Controls
3) Safety mechanism (one sentence explaining how it reduces anxiety/uncertainty/regret)
4) A concrete user interaction (what the user does in the product)

Constraints:
- No generic clichés (e.g., “AI-powered personalized investing” without specifics).
- Prioritize psychological safety: reduce fear of loss, fear of being wrong, and fear of not knowing enough.
- Keep ideas implementable and distinct.

Output format:
Numbered list 1–25. Keep each idea compact but specific.


## Iteration 1 Output

1. Idea name: Comfort Zone Filters
   Ring mechanism: Motion Zones/Sensitivity

   Ring mechanism: Live View
   Safety mechanism: Real-time plan impact makes each choice feel transparent and predictable.
   User interaction: User hovers over an ETF and watches live gauges update for diversification, risk, and monthly budget impact.

3. Idea name: Gentle Threshold Nudge Alerts
   Ring mechanism: Motion Alerts
   Safety mechanism: Alerts only trigger on user-set thresholds, reducing FOMO and panic from random noise.
   User interaction: User sets “Notify if price < fair value by 5% and risk score ≤ my limit.”

4. Idea name: Decision Timeline Playback
   Ring mechanism: Event History/Playback
   Safety mechanism: Seeing exactly how and why you decided reduces regret and self-blame.
   User interaction: User replays a past pick’s timeline showing checked criteria, notes, and market context at the moment.

5. Idea name: Trusted Buddy Review

25. Idea name: Alert Sensitivity Dial
    Ring mechanism: Motion Zones/Sensitivity
    Safety mechanism: Controlling alert intensity reduces stress from over-notification.
    User interaction: User sets the dial to “Only major plan breaches” or “All small nudges” and tests with a preview.


---

## Critique 1 (and Prompt 2)

[CRITIQUE]
- Repetition: Several ideas repeat patterns with minor phrasing changes (e.g., 1 vs. 17 both zone filters; 3 vs. 25 both alert tuning; 7, 13, 18, 24 all “modes/cool-down/stepwise” variations). This reduces breadth.
- Vagueness: Many items don’t specify what data triggers actions or what the UI shows (e.g., 6 “Explain-Back Quick Chat” doesn’t state inputs/outputs beyond a summary; 12 “Risk Heat Live Map” lacks the specific risk signals).
- Missing directions: No distribution guidance led to overuse of a few mechanisms and under-exploration of moments in the decision journey (before/during/after/ongoing). No tags to cluster by stage or fear type.
- Weak Ring mapping: Although each idea names a Ring mechanism, the mapping is often implied rather than explicit (“what Motion Alerts mean in investing” is not consistently spelled out).
- Safety mechanism clarity: Some one-liners clearly reduce anxiety (10, 13), others are generic reassurance without stating the specific uncertainty reduced (6, 21).
- Emotional safety gaps: Social features (5, 22) could increase shame if not tightly scoped; the prompt didn’t require naming which fear is addressed, so “safety” is broad and diffuse.
- Feasibility: Most are plausible, but some depend on open-ended NLP or advisory gray areas (6, 14) without constraints to keep them implementable and compliant.
- Clustering difficulty: Without tags for moment or fear type, the set is harder to organize and compare.

Prompt causes:
- It asks to use Ring-like mechanisms but doesn’t enforce explicit mechanism-to-analog mapping.
- No distribution constraints across Ring features or decision moments.
- No requirement to declare which fear is targeted, so “safety” stays abstract.
- No instruction to specify concrete triggers/inputs and outputs, enabling vague interactions.
- No feasibility or compliance guardrails, allowing ideas that drift into advisory or complex AI.
- Output schema leaves little structure for clustering or deduplication.

[REVISED_PROMPT]
You are generating concept ideas for a design project.

PRIMARY GOAL (non-negotiable):
Make choosing investments FEEL emotionally safe and reassuring for young adults / beginner investors. Interpret “safe and reassuring” as: calm, non-overwhelming, confidence-building, low-regret, low-shame, protective, and supportive.

HMW:
How might we make choosing investments feel as safe and reassuring as using a Ring Doorbell?

Audience:
Young adults / beginner investors

Analogy reminder:
Ring Doorbell evokes safety via Live View, Motion Alerts, Event History/Playback, Motion Zones/Sensitivity, Shared Access, Two-Way Talk, Modes Home/Away, Snapshot/Check-in, Privacy Controls. Use these as mechanisms to create safety, not as superficial feature copies.

Generation task:
Generate exactly 25 distinct, implementable concept ideas for a software service (mobile/web) that helps young adults choose what to invest in.

For EACH idea, include exactly these fields in this order:
- Name: 3–6 words
- Ring mechanism: choose exactly one from [Live View, Motion Alerts, Event History/Playback, Motion Zones/Sensitivity, Shared Access, Two-Way Talk, Modes Home/Away, Snapshot/Check-in, Privacy Controls]
- Moment: choose one from [Before, During, After, Ongoing]
- Safety target: choose 1–2 from [fear_of_loss, fear_of_being_wrong, fear_of_not_knowing, FOMO, regret, shame]
- Why this increases safety: one sentence that explicitly maps the Ring mechanism to an investing equivalent using this pattern: “In Ring, [mechanism] does X; here it becomes Y, which reduces Z.”
- User interaction: one sentence starting with “User …” that names at least one concrete input (e.g., toggle, threshold, selection) and one concrete output (e.g., card, label, graph, alert) the user sees.

Constraints:
- Balance: Use every Ring mechanism at least 2 times across the 25 ideas; limit any single mechanism to at most 4 ideas. Cover all Moments (Before, During, After, Ongoing) with at least 4 ideas each.
- Implementability: No hardware; software-only; plausible within ~3 months by a small product team. Use mainstream data/signals only (e.g., prices, fees, volatility, diversification metrics, news headlines, user-defined rules).
- Compliance/claims: No personalized financial advice, no performance guarantees, no trading signals that imply certainty. Frame outputs as education, rules, and explainable checks.
- Specificity: No generic clichés like “AI-powered personalization.” Every idea must specify a trigger, control, or rule and a visible artifact/result.
- Distinctness: Avoid near-duplicates. Each idea must differ meaningfully by mechanism, moment, interaction, or safety target.
- Tone: Prioritize psychological safety; avoid social comparison or leaderboards. Shared features must minimize shame.

Output format:
Numbered list 1–25. For each item, print the six labeled lines exactly as specified. Keep each idea compact (≤60 words total).

## Critique 2 (and Prompt 3)

[CRITIQUE]
- Repetition: Several ideas converge on similar artifacts (many “cards,” multiple snapshot variants). While mechanisms are balanced, output types feel repetitive, limiting differentiation.
- Vagueness: A few ideas (e.g., “thesis drift” via headlines, “tracking error over years”) risk unclear data availability or logic without specifying simple, obtainable signals.
- Missing directions: No clustering structure beyond Moments; hard to group for product planning. Lacks explicit categories for onboarding, education, alerts, etc.
- Weak Ring mapping: Most map well, but a few are thin adaptations (e.g., generic “co-view” shares) that could better leverage Ring’s specific safety mechanics (zones, modes, privacy-first defaults).
- Safety clarity: Safety targets are named, but emotional safeguards (tone, non-judgmental microcopy, anonymized sharing) could be more consistently enforced, especially for Social/Shared ideas.
- Feasibility: Generally plausible, but some items may need niche data (tracking error history), which could exceed a 3‑month scope; more emphasis on mainstream, readily available signals would help.

PROMPT issues that caused this:
- The prompt privileged “Moments” over functional categories, making clustering by user need harder.
- It did not require artifact diversity across the set, leading to many “card” outputs.
- It allowed broad data references (e.g., “thesis drift”) without bounding to simple signals, creating feasibility ambiguity.
- Social/Shared features weren’t forced to include privacy defaults, risking emotional safety gaps.
- It didn’t require distribution across functional categories, so coverage could skew.
- It didn’t require the safety mechanism line to explicitly name a safety target from a controlled list, allowing inconsistency.

Improvements (constraints/additions):
- Require category coverage: at least 3 ideas in each category (Onboarding, Decision Support, Risk Alerts, Education, Social Support, Post-Decision Support), max 6 per category.
- Enforce ring_feature distribution: use each Ring feature 2–4 times across the set.
- Artifact diversity: across all ideas, include at least 6 distinct output artifacts (e.g., badge, banner, modal, checklist, timeline, graph, alert, drawer, tooltip, snapshot).
- Concrete inputs and outputs: each idea’s “what_user_does” must name at least one specific input control and one specific output artifact.
- Data feasibility: limit to mainstream, readily accessible signals (prices, percent changes, fees, volatility bands, diversification metrics, broad news headlines, user-entered notes/rules); avoid niche datasets.
- Social safety: Social Support ideas must mention default masking/anonymization controls in “what_user_does.”
- Safety mechanism precision: require the safety sentence to follow the exact mapping pattern and include one safety target from [fear_of_loss, fear_of_being_wrong, fear_of_not_knowing, FOMO, regret, shame].
- Distinctness rule: each idea must differ by at least one of ring_feature, category, trigger/condition, or output artifact.

[REVISED_PROMPT]
You are generating concept ideas for a design project.

Primary goal (non‑negotiable):
Make choosing investments feel emotionally safe and reassuring for young adults/beginner investors (calm, non‑overwhelming, confidence‑building, low‑regret, low‑shame, protective, supportive).

HMW:
How might we make choosing investments feel as safe and reassuring as using a Ring Doorbell?

Analogy reminder:
Use Ring mechanisms as safety mechanisms, not superficial copies. Allowed ring_feature values:
- Live View
- Motion Alerts
- Event History/Playback
- Motion Zones/Sensitivity
- Shared Access
- Two-Way Talk
- Modes Home/Away
- Snapshot/Check-in
- Privacy Controls

Generation task:
Produce exactly 25 distinct, implementable software concepts (mobile/web) that help young adults choose what to invest in.

Output format:
Return a JSON array of exactly 25 objects. Each object must have these fields only:
- idea_name: 3–6 words.
- ring_feature: one of the allowed Ring features above.
- what_user_does: exactly one sentence that includes at least one concrete input (e.g., toggle, slider, dropdown, threshold, text field, selection) and at least one concrete output artifact (e.g., alert, badge, banner, modal, graph, timeline, checklist, snapshot card, tooltip, drawer).
- safety_mechanism: exactly one sentence following this exact pattern and naming a safety target from the list: “In Ring, [ring_feature] does X; here it becomes Y, which reduces [fear_of_loss|fear_of_being_wrong|fear_of_not_knowing|FOMO|regret|shame].”
- category: one of [Onboarding, Decision Support, Risk Alerts, Education, Social Support, Post-Decision Support].

Constraints:
- Ring feature coverage: Use each ring_feature at least 2 times and at most 4 times across the 25 ideas.
- Category coverage: Include at least 3 ideas in each category and at most 6 in any single category.
- Implementability: Software-only; plausible to prototype within ~3 months by a small team. Use only mainstream, readily accessible signals (e.g., prices, percent/daily changes, basic volatility bands, drawdowns, fees/expense ratios, diversification metrics, simple news/headline keywords, user-entered rules/notes). No performance guarantees or implied-certainty trading signals. Frame outputs as education, rules, explainable checks.
- Social safety: Any idea in Social Support must include masking/anonymization defaults in “what_user_does” (e.g., mask balances, redact PII).
- Artifact diversity: Across all 25 ideas, include at least 6 distinct output artifact types (examples: badge, banner, modal, checklist, timeline, graph, alert, drawer, tooltip, snapshot card). Avoid overusing a single artifact.
- Distinctness: Each idea must differ meaningfully by at least one of ring_feature, category, trigger/condition, or output artifact. Avoid near-duplicates.
- Tone: Supportive and non-judgmental; avoid social comparison and leaderboards.

Checklist before you output:
- Count ring_feature usages to ensure each appears 2–4 times.
- Ensure category distribution: 3–6 per category.
- Verify each “safety_mechanism” follows the exact sentence pattern and names one safety target.
- Verify each “what_user_does” contains both a concrete input and a concrete output artifact.
- Ensure artifact variety across the set (≥6 distinct output artifact types).

Output only the JSON array, no extra commentary.

## Iteration 3 Prompt

You are generating concept ideas for a design project.

Primary goal (non‑negotiable):
Make choosing investments feel emotionally safe and reassuring for young adults/beginner investors (calm, non‑overwhelming, confidence‑building, low‑regret, low‑shame, protective, supportive).

HMW:
How might we make choosing investments feel as safe and reassuring as using a Ring Doorbell?

Analogy reminder:
Use Ring mechanisms as safety mechanisms, not superficial copies. Allowed ring_feature values:
- Live View
- Motion Alerts
- Event History/Playback
- Motion Zones/Sensitivity
- Shared Access
- Two-Way Talk
- Modes Home/Away
- Snapshot/Check-in
- Privacy Controls

Generation task:
Produce exactly 25 distinct, implementable software concepts (mobile/web) that help young adults choose what to invest in.

Output format:
Return a JSON array of exactly 25 objects. Each object must have these fields only:
- idea_name: 3–6 words.
- ring_feature: one of the allowed Ring features above.
- what_user_does: exactly one sentence that includes at least one concrete input (e.g., toggle, slider, dropdown, threshold, text field, selection) and at least one concrete output artifact (e.g., alert, badge, banner, modal, graph, timeline, checklist, snapshot card, tooltip, drawer).
- safety_mechanism: exactly one sentence following this exact pattern and naming a safety target from the list: “In Ring, [ring_feature] does X; here it becomes Y, which reduces [fear_of_loss|fear_of_being_wrong|fear_of_not_knowing|FOMO|regret|shame].”
- category: one of [Onboarding, Decision Support, Risk Alerts, Education, Social Support, Post-Decision Support].

Constraints:
- Ring feature coverage: Use each ring_feature at least 2 times and at most 4 times across the 25 ideas.
- Category coverage: Include at least 3 ideas in each category and at most 6 in any single category.
- Implementability: Software-only; plausible to prototype within ~3 months by a small team. Use only mainstream, readily accessible signals (e.g., prices, percent/daily changes, basic volatility bands, drawdowns, fees/expense ratios, diversification metrics, simple news/headline keywords, user-entered rules/notes). No performance guarantees or implied-certainty trading signals. Frame outputs as education, rules, explainable checks.
- Social safety: Any idea in Social Support must include masking/anonymization defaults in “what_user_does” (e.g., mask balances, redact PII).
- Artifact diversity: Across all 25 ideas, include at least 6 distinct output artifact types (examples: badge, banner, modal, checklist, timeline, graph, alert, drawer, tooltip, snapshot card). Avoid overusing a single artifact.
- Distinctness: Each idea must differ meaningfully by at least one of ring_feature, category, trigger/condition, or output artifact. Avoid near-duplicates.
- Tone: Supportive and non-judgmental; avoid social comparison and leaderboards.

Checklist before you output:
- Count ring_feature usages to ensure each appears 2–4 times.
- Ensure category distribution: 3–6 per category.
- Verify each “safety_mechanism” follows the exact sentence pattern and names one safety target.
- Verify each “what_user_does” contains both a concrete input and a concrete output artifact.
- Ensure artifact variety across the set (≥6 distinct output artifact types).

Output only the JSON array, no extra commentary.
