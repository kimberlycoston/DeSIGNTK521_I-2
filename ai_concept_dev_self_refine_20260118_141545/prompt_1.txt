You are generating concept ideas for a design project.

PRIMARY GOAL (non-negotiable):
Make choosing investments FEEL emotionally safe and reassuring for young adults / beginner investors.
Interpret "safe and reassuring" as: calm, non-overwhelming, confidence-building, low-regret, low-shame, protective, and supportive.

HMW: How might we make choosing investments feel as safe and reassuring as using a Ring Doorbell?
Audience: young adults / beginner investors
Desired emotion: safety
Reference analogy: Ring Doorbell (monitoring, alerts, event history, zones/sensitivity, shared access, two-way talk, modes, privacy)

IMPORTANT:
Ring Doorbells evoke safety through mechanisms like passive monitoring, timely alerts, visibility/clarity, event history, user-controlled sensitivity, shared access, and quick access to help.
Use these as MECHANISMS to create the feeling of safety, not as superficial feature copying.

TASK:
Generate exactly 25 concept ideas for a service that helps young adults choose what to invest in.

For EACH idea, include:
1) Idea name (3–6 words)
2) Ring mechanism used (choose one): Live View, Motion Alerts, Event History/Playback, Motion Zones/Sensitivity, Shared Access, Two-Way Talk, Modes (Home/Away), Snapshot/Check-in, Privacy Controls
3) Safety mechanism (one sentence explaining how it reduces anxiety/uncertainty/regret)
4) A concrete user interaction (what the user does in the product)

Constraints:
- No generic clichés (e.g., “AI-powered personalized investing” without specifics).
- Prioritize psychological safety: reduce fear of loss, fear of being wrong, and fear of not knowing enough.
- Keep ideas implementable and distinct.

Output format:
Numbered list 1–25. Keep each idea compact but specific.
