You are doing affinity diagramming on 25 design concepts for an investing-confidence project.

Goal emotion: SAFE + REASSURING.
Analogy: Ring Doorbell (monitoring, alerts, event history, zones, shared access, two-way talk, privacy).

TASK:
Cluster the 25 ideas into 5–8 affinity clusters.
Each cluster must be defined by a distinct "safety mechanism" (e.g., passive reassurance, guardrails, sensemaking, social reassurance, privacy, escalation).

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only):
{
  "clusters": [
    {
      "cluster_name": "...",
      "cluster_definition": "...(1 sentence)...",
      "safety_mechanism": "...(short)...",
      "idea_names": ["Idea 1", "Idea 2"]
    }
  ],
  "notes": ["1–3 brief observations about the set"]
}

RULES:
- Every idea_name must appear exactly once across all clusters.
- Cluster names must be short and non-overlapping.
- Keep it grounded: do not invent new ideas—only cluster what's provided.
