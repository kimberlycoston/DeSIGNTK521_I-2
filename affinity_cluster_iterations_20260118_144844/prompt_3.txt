You previously created an affinity clustering for these ideas. Now act as a critique-and-improve facilitator.

INPUTS:
1) The original ideas (below)
2) Your previous clustering output (below)

YOUR JOB:
1) Critique the previous clustering for:
   - overlapping clusters
   - clusters that are too broad or too narrow
   - clusters that do not align with the target emotion (safe + reassuring)
   - whether the cluster lens is the best one for design insight
2) Propose a NEW clustering lens (choose one):
   - By timing (prevent / detect / respond / recover)
   - By user agency (passive / guided / social / expert)
   - By uncertainty type (knowledge / outcome / identity-shame / privacy / manipulation)
   - By interaction mode (alerts / dashboards / journaling / social / expert escalation)
3) Re-cluster the ideas using that new lens into 5–8 clusters.
