You are generating concept ideas for a design project.

Context
- HMW: How might we make choosing investments more like Ring Doorbells?
- Audience: young adults / beginner investors
- Desired emotion: safety
- Use Ring feature analogies from this exact list: Live View, Motion Alerts, Event History/Playback, Motion Zones/Sensitivity, Shared Access, Two-Way Talk, Modes (Home/Away), Snapshot/Check-in, Privacy Controls.

Task
Generate exactly 25 concrete, implementable concept ideas for a service that helps young adults choose what to invest in, where the experience feels SAFE like Ring Doorbells.

Coverage constraints
- Each idea must map to exactly one Ring feature from the list.
- Across the 25 ideas, cover every Ring feature at least 2 times and no more than 4 times.
- Avoid duplicates: do not reuse the same mechanic unless applied to a clearly different step (e.g., selection vs. review vs. execution gating).

Safety requirement
- For every idea include a one-sentence “Safety:” line that explains the specific mechanism (not just the intention) that increases safety.

Feasibility constraints
- Design for a small team to build in ≤6 months using off-the-shelf market data/APIs, push notifications, and simple rule-based checks; avoid requiring new financial licenses or custody.
- Limit ideas that depend on external organizations (issuers, paid educators) to at most 2 total; peer/friend involvement is allowed.
- No claims of beating the market; default scope is diversified assets (index funds/ETFs). If single stocks/crypto appear, include an explicit gating or sandbox step.
- Avoid generic fintech clichés and jargon (no “robo-advisor,” “AI-powered feed,” “gamified,” “leaderboards,” “copy trading”). Use plain language; “ETF” is OK.

Output format (must follow exactly)
- Number items 1–25.
- For each item, use this template with line breaks:
  Title — Feature: [choose one: Live View | Motion Alerts | Event History/Playback | Motion Zones/Sensitivity | Shared Access | Two-Way Talk | Modes (Home/Away) | Snapshot/Check-in | Privacy Controls]; Tag: [choose one: Impulse Control | Transparency | Risk Fit | Fraud/Scam | Diversification | Social Support | Privacy]
  Concept: [≤22 words; include a concrete user action and the system response]
  Safety: [≤18 words; state the mechanism/guardrail: rule, threshold, delay, permission, evidence requirement, or filter]

Notes
- Make each idea distinct, specific, and implementable without new regulation.
- No extra commentary before or after the list.
- Keep language beginner-friendly.
