    "output": "1. Market Motion Zones: Draw your own \u201czones\u201d (e.g., US large-cap, sustainable ETFs) and the app only suggests investments inside them unless you explicitly unlock an \u201cUnknown Zone\u201d for 24 hours.\n\n2. Sensitivity Slider: Set your volatility tolerance and the feed only shows assets whose historical swings fit; anything outside shows an \u201cOut of Sensitivity\u201d warning with a rationale.\n\n3. Event History Clips: Every suggestion logs a 15\u201330 second explainer clip of what triggered it (fee drop, earnings, regulation) so you can replay how and why it appeared.\n\n4. Verified Visitor Badge: Assets earn a safety badge if they meet concrete criteria (low fees, diversified holdings, >3-year track record, clean audit); unbadged items require a cooling-off period before buying.\n\n5. Two-Way Talk with Issuers: Tap to hear 60-second audio answers from ETF/company IR to beginner questions (what it holds, fees, risk), vetted and time-stamped.\n\n6. Neighborhood Watch Lists: Join a small trusted circle (family/class/club) that maintains an allowlist/blocklist; your suggestions respect the group\u2019s guardrails by default.\n\n7. Porch Mode (Sandbox): New picks appear in a sandbox where you can simulate, follow alerts, and collect notes for 14 days before the buy button unlocks.\n\n8. Stranger Knock Alert: If hype or social chatter spikes beyond fundamentals, the pick is flagged with a \u201cStranger Knock\u201d label and a one-screen explanation of specific risks.\n\n9. Zone Overlap Warning: Before recommending, the app shows how much the asset duplicates your current exposure (by sector/country/factor) so you avoid concentration.\n\n10. Safe Hours: Set a curfew (e.g., 10pm\u20138am) that blocks buy actions and limits the app to education and simulation to reduce impulsive choices.\n\n11. Shared Access Roles: Grant a mentor read-only access to your candidate list with comment rights; only you can approve or execute.\n\n12. Scam Siren: Automated checks for pump patterns or fake filings trigger a hard stop, display evidence links, and enforce a 24-hour wait.\n\n13. Quick Retreat Button: One tap hides all high-risk categories for 30 days and limits suggestions to broad, diversified funds within your zones.\n\n14. Privacy Shutter: Share a pick to get feedback while automatically blurring your balances and amounts; others only see the asset, your notes, and the risk label.\n\n15. Doorbell Chime Digest: Receive a single daily digest with at most three reviewed suggestions, each with a 30-second plain-language summary and risk grade.\n\n16. Guest Pass to Educators: Send a pick to a vetted educator for an asynchronous 10-minute voice-note Q&A; responses are saved to the asset\u2019s history.\n\n17. Zone Calibration Walkthrough: Monthly 5-minute check-in adjusts your zones automatically based on how comfortable you were with recent volatility and outcomes.\n\n18. Dividend Package Preview: For dividend assets, show a delivery calendar with estimated payout dates, past reliability, and tax notes before you add it.\n\n19. Masked Browsing Mode: Explore ideas without training the algorithm; nothing affects future suggestions unless you explicitly save.\n\n20. Door Knock Challenge: For high-risk picks, answer three prompts (how it earns, worst-case loss, exit plan) before the buy button unlocks; your answers are stored for review.\n\n21. Away Mode (Low-Noise): When enabled, the app hides new ideas and only surfaces maintenance suggestions (rebalance, contribution reminders) until you turn it off.\n\n22. Zone-Specific Mute: Mute a sector or theme (e.g., crypto) for 90 days so it disappears from lists and alerts until you unmute.\n\n23. Evidence Tiles: Each suggestion shows four tappable tiles\u2014fee, diversification score, max drawdown, independent sources\u2014that must be opened before you can buy.\n\n24. Friend-at-the-Door: Invite a trusted friend to leave a 30-second voice comment on a pick; you must listen to proceed, adding helpful friction.\n\n25. Low-Light Summaries: Auto-translate complex filings into three simple bullet summaries with highlighted red flags and audio playback for quick, safe understanding."

    "critique_and_rewrite": "[CRITIQUE]\n- Repetition: Multiple ideas rely on the same safety levers (cooling-off periods, buy-button locks, mentorship comments) with minor rewording. Access-control themes repeat (Shared Access, Friend/Mentor roles) without distinct contexts.\n- Vagueness: \u201cTwo-Way Talk with Issuers,\u201d \u201cGuest Pass to Educators,\u201d and \u201cScam Siren\u201d lack implementable detail (how answers are sourced/vetted, data signals used, moderation, legal/compliance). \u201cNeighborhood Watch Lists\u201d and \u201cShared Access Roles\u201d don\u2019t clarify permissions or broker compliance boundaries.\n- Missing directions: The output doesn\u2019t explicitly map each idea to a Ring feature, making the analogy uneven and harder to cluster. Some Ring features (Live View, Snapshot/Check-in) are underused or absent, while Motion Zones/Sensitivity and Modes dominate.\n- Weak connection to Ring: Many concepts feel \u201csafety in fintech\u201d rather than \u201cRing-like,\u201d because the Ring element is implied instead of named and translated (e.g., \u201cStranger Knock\u201d is clever but doesn\u2019t specify which Ring feature it is analogizing).\n- Safety mechanism clarity: Several ideas state a risk label or badge but don\u2019t specify the mechanism or criteria source (e.g., what data powers \u201cStranger Knock\u201d or \u201cVerified Visitor\u201d? Who sets thresholds?).\n- Feasibility: Several require heavy partnerships (issuers, educators) or complex detection (scam/pump) that may exceed a small-team, 6-month build.

Shared Access items 13\u201315 all center on oversight for discretionary trades with similar mechanics.\n- Vagueness: Many \u201cSafety\u201d lines lack concrete triggers or enforcement objects (e.g., \u201cconservative historical percentiles,\u201d \u201cvetted market API\u201d without thresholds, \u201capproved via identity verification\u201d without what\u2019s gated). Numeric thresholds and explicit disable/lock actions are often missing.\n- Weak/mixed Ring mapping: Some features are broadly \u201cfintech\u201d and don\u2019t emphasize the Ring metaphor strongly (e.g., \u201cWeekly Snapshot Card\u201d could more clearly mirror Snapshot/Check-in periodicity; \u201cDecision Playback Journal\u201d is good, but others read as generic alerts).\n- Missing structural signals: No clustering by journey stage; this makes it harder to see coverage across Onboarding, Decision Support, Risk Alerts, etc. Outputs weren\u2019t in a structured schema (harder to parse or deduplicate).\n- Feasibility watch-outs: Human moderation (\u201cPump Report Hotline\u201d) and identity-verified volunteers could exceed a small team\u2019s capacity; reliance on filing broker reports hints at external org dependencies. Some \u201caudited index data\u201d claims may be unrealistic; better to cite mainstream APIs and rules.\n- Overlapping scope: Several ideas target allocation drift and ETF filters; fewer unique mechanics for fraud prevention beyond whitelists and pumps.
